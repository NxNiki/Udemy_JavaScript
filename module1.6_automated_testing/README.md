# problem solving:

1. interpret the prompt
2. IOCE (input, output, constraints, edge case)
3. write tests
4. high level strategy (make a diagram)
5. pseudocode the strategy
6. implement the solution

note: readability is important to your productivity, as it may takes several rounds of reviews before your pull request is accepted.
